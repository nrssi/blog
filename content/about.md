Hi I'm N R Shyamsundar Iyanger, A CSE undergrad currently in third year, A systems programming junkie, open-source enthusiast.
I'm currently interested in cyber security.I love watching anime, coding, working on online CTF games, watching more anime and much more anime.

I mainly concentrate writing blogs in these areas : 
1. Open-source software.
2. Programming in systems languages like C, rust.
3. Computer science topics.
4. Cyber security

If you are interested in any of the above mentioned topics, you are welcome to be my online bestfriend.
I personally feel that there's a lot of toxicity in social media, so I don't hang around much in any of the platforms.
Although you can DM me on my [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/n_r_s_s_i) account I keep it for watching memes (Yes, I love them) .
If you need a more professional way to approach reach me at ***shyamblogs@protonmail.com***
